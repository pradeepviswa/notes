# Load balancer
1. health check
2. create target group, later EC2 instances will be added here.
3. create web server in 2 different availability zones, use same security group
4. attach 2 web servers in target group
5. attach target group to the load balancer


Questions:
Can we have one server in different regions? One in N. Virgenia and another in OHIO?
Instead of using DNS URL generated by LB, can we assign our own DNS name?

1. CREATE VMS IN 2 DIFFERENT AVAILABILITY ZONES
AZ - az3
web1 - 54.146.92.206
SG  sg-0d21efb1072eb917a (launch-wizard-1)

AZ - az4
web2 - 54.237.237.156
SG - sg-020a6cbadde978432 (launch-wizard-2)

2. create target group:
   Name: My-Target-Group
   choose VPC --> next
   In target group, select both EC2 instances --> click on "Include as a pending below"
   Next --> Create target group
3. create application load balancer   
   Name: My-ALB
   Availability Zone: select AZs where VMs are present
   Security Group: select common security group configured  while creating EC2 instance
   Add target group: My-Target-Group
   click on "Create load balancer"


# Auto Scaling
  scale up / out
  scale down / in
  
  EC2 --> Autoscaling Group
  create autoscaling group
  name: my-autoscaling-group
  create a launch configuration
    create launch template, select security group, key, AMI
   
  select availability zones - select all AZs --> Next
  No load balancer
  Desired Capacity: 
    formula: greater than or equal to desired capacity
  Target tracking scaling policy
     target value: 50
     next is 30

  Next, Next --> Create autoscaling group
