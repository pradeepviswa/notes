Q. Transfer of instance from one region to another?
A. Directly not possible. Follow below steps
1. Create an EC2 instance and install a web server in it.
2. Create an AMI of that EC2 instance
   This is custom AMI
   Select Image --> Actions --> Image and Template --> Create Image --> Image Name set and click on Create Image
   
3. Copy this custom AMI from one region to another region
   select new Images -> AMI --> Action --> Copy AMI --> select OHIO region
   
4. Create a new Instance in new Region from this AMI 
   

reverse:
in ohio:
 delete ec2 instance
 Deactivate AMI images
in n-virgenia:
 delete ec2
 delete AMI image
